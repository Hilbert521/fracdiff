    "Linear systems involving Toeplitz matrices arise in many applications, including differential and integral equations and signal and image processing (see, e.g., [this article](https://www.ercim.eu/publication/Ercim_News/enw22/toeplitz.html) and the books by [Ng](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/iterative-methods-for-toeplitz-systems-9780198504207?cc=gb&lang=en&), and [Chan and Jin](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898718850)). More recently, Toeplitz systems have appeared in [discretisations of fractional diffusion problems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnum.2005.02.008). This is because fractional diffusion operators are non-local, and lead to dense matrices; if these dense matrices are Toeplitz, it's possible to develop [fast solvers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2011.10.005). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent [blog post](https://www.nag.co.uk/content/exploiting-matrix-structure-solution-linear-systems) for [NAG](https://www.nag.co.uk), [Mike Croucher](https://www.nag.co.uk/content/mike-croucher) showed that using specialised direct Toeplitz solvers, rather than a generic solver, can result in a massive speed-up. Here, we show that in addition to these tailored direct approaches, preconditioned iterative methods can be competitive for these problems. Perhaps suprisingly, this is true even when the Toeplitz matrix is dense.  "

Since $A$ has (at most) $2n-1$ degrees of freedom, it's perhaps not surpsing that we can solve this linear system with $O(n^2)$ or fewer flops, using fast or [superfast](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~yxi26/PDF/toeprs.pdf) solvers.

    "Direct solvers for Toeplitz matrices can be extremely fast. However, \n",
    "for certain problems, particularly those for which a fast direct method isn't readily available, iterative solvers can be a great alternative. In the example above, both GMRES and MINRES were orders of magnitude faster than the general-purpose solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative solvers are often daunting for practitioners, because they are not \"black box\" methods. Hopefully the example above shows that this need not be a barrier; fast matrix-vector products and preconditioners may only require a couple of lines of code. Our experience is that the MINRES method proposed above is typically faster than GMRES when a good preconditioner is available, but other nonsymmetric solvers, such as CGS, BiCGStab or TFQMR may also be good options. The nice thing about the NAG library is that switching between these iterative methods requires only a few small changes to the code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that for some problems the simple preconditioners above may not be so suitable. However, there are now many options available for different types of systems, with the books by [Ng](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/iterative-methods-for-toeplitz-systems-9780198504207?cc=gb&lang=en&), and [Chan and Jin](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9780898718850) a great place to start.
